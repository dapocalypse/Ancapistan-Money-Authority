# An economy bot for a discord guild called Discord Plays Stellaris 

## The Rewrite Branch
Set-up is simple, clone this repo, open in a .NET IDE, make sure to add a Resource for the bot token and rethinkdb path (Look it up if you don't know how) and compile.

## TL;DR of the license.
Do whatever you want with the code, BUT disclose the source and any changes you have done from the original.
